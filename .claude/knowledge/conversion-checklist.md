# Conversion Checklist for Landing Pages

This checklist helps optimize landing pages for conversion.

## Philosophy

**Focus: Does it SELL, not does it WORK.**

Landing pages are about conversion optimization:
- Is the value proposition clear?
- Does the CTA stand out?
- Are trust signals present?
- Does mobile experience convert?

## Hero Section Criteria

### Value Proposition (Critical)

**Clear Headline Test:**
- Can a visitor understand what you do within 3 seconds?
- Does it pass the "So what?" test? (Benefit > Feature)
- Is it specific to your audience?

**Good examples:**
- "Get 2x more replies to your cold emails" (specific benefit)
- "AI that writes like your best performer" (differentiation)

**Bad examples:**
- "The Future of Communication" (vague)
- "Powerful AI Platform" (feature, not benefit)
- "Welcome to Our Website" (says nothing)

### Visual Hierarchy

**F-Pattern / Z-Pattern:**
- Eyes naturally scan in F or Z patterns
- Key information should be in these hot zones
- Logo (top-left) → Headline → CTA → Supporting content

**White Space:**
- Cramped = cheap/untrustworthy
- Too sparse = confusing/incomplete
- Balance = professional/focused

## CTA Criteria

### Button Psychology

**Color Contrast:**
- CTA should be the most visually prominent element
- Contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 for accessibility
- Avoid CTA color matching brand colors everywhere

**Button Size:**
- Desktop: minimum 44x44px clickable area
- Mobile: minimum 48x48px touch target
- Thumb-friendly placement on mobile

### Copy Psychology

**Action + Benefit Pattern:**
- "Start Free Trial" > "Submit"
- "Get Your Report" > "Download"
- "See Pricing" > "Click Here"

**Friction Reducers:**
- "No credit card required"
- "Free for 14 days"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "Takes 30 seconds"

**Urgency (use sparingly):**
- "Limited spots available"
- "Price increases Jan 1"
- Avoid fake urgency - damages trust

## Trust Signals Criteria

### Social Proof Hierarchy (strongest → weakest)

1. **Specific numbers:** "10,847 teams use us" > "Many teams use us"
2. **Named testimonials:** Real name + photo + company > Anonymous
3. **Third-party validation:** G2, Capterra, TrustPilot badges
4. **Logo walls:** Known brands > Unknown brands
5. **Case studies:** Specific results > Generic praise
6. **Media mentions:** TechCrunch, Forbes, etc.

### Credibility Signals

**For SaaS/Tech:**
- Security badges (SOC2, GDPR)
- Uptime guarantees
- Data location info

**For E-commerce:**
- SSL/secure checkout badges
- Money-back guarantee
- Return policy visibility

**For B2B:**
- Enterprise client logos
- Industry certifications
- Team credentials

## Mobile-Specific Criteria

### Above-the-Fold Priority

Mobile visitors see ~30% of desktop content on first screen:
1. Logo (small)
2. Headline (must fit)
3. CTA (must be visible)
4. One trust signal if possible

### Touch Targets

Apple HIG: 44x44pt minimum
Material Design: 48x48dp minimum

Common mistakes:
- Links too close together
- Tiny hamburger menus
- Unclickable phone numbers

### Content Adaptation

**Good mobile adaptations:**
- Simplified navigation (hamburger OK)
- Stacked layouts (not side-by-side)
- Shortened copy
- Larger fonts (16px minimum)

**Bad mobile experiences:**
- Horizontal scrolling required
- Pinch-to-zoom required to read
- Pop-ups covering content
- Auto-playing video

## Pricing Section Criteria

### Tier Presentation

**Anchoring effect:**
- Show most expensive first (makes others seem reasonable)
- OR highlight middle tier (compromise effect)
- Never make cheapest tier look best

**Visual highlighting:**
- "Most Popular" badge on target tier
- Different background color
- Larger card or raised position

### Feature Comparison

**Scannable format:**
- Checkmarks > text descriptions
- Group features by category
- Highlight differentiating features

**Avoid:**
- Too many tiers (3-4 optimal)
- Feature overload (decision paralysis)
- Hidden important limitations

## Common Conversion Killers

### Instant Credibility Destroyers
- Stock photos of handshakes
- "Lorem ipsum" anywhere
- Broken images
- Generic testimonials ("Great product!" - J.S.)
- Spelling/grammar errors

### Friction Points
- Required signup to see pricing
- Long forms for simple actions
- No guest checkout
- Mandatory phone number
- CAPTCHA on every action

### Mobile Deal-Breakers
- Interstitials covering content
- "View Desktop Site" needed
- Text too small to read
- CTA below multiple scrolls
- Hamburger menu with 20+ items
